# Purpose

This "template" folder contains templates and associates scripts to generate
standard repository files such as README.md and LICENSE.  This is primarily
used by the author to ensure consistency across repositories and can safely be
ignored by most end users and contributors.

# Usage

You can regenerate the documents from templates using the following command
from the main repository folder:

    $ make regenMakefile
    $ make regenDocMain
